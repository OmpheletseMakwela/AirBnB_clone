How to use it
The console (command interpreter) supports two different modes which are interactive mode and also the non-interactive mode.
Interactive mode:
The console will display a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the user can write and execute a command. After the command is run, the prompt will appear again a wait for a new command. This can go indefinitely as long as the user does not exit the program.

Non-interactive mode:
The shell will need to be run with a command input piped into its execution so that the command is run as soon as the Shell starts. In this mode no prompt will appear, and no further input will be expected from the user.
